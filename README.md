# OpenCV Python Project

Submitted by: Divyarajsinh Karmariya

*A python-based object detector for images and videos using the OpenCV Deep Neural Networks (DNN) module and Googlenet!*
Using blobs (the equivalent of tensors in other frameworks), and leveraging YOLOv3 for custom object detection.

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ X ] Detects objects in an image and, also displays the different color channels.
- [ X ] Detects objects within videos and shows the probability of the object.
- [ X ]Using YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) neural network trained on COCO dataset.
- [ X ] YOLO divides images into regions and predicts bounding boxes and probability for each region.
 


I came across various challenges while building this project.
- [ X ] Understanding the OpenCV neural network and other pre-trained models and their algorithms for detecting objects.
- [ X ] Debugging the code while determining important information within the image or video file.
- [ X ] Classifying images using inference and video classification
